<div style="text-align: center;">Generate recovery seed</div>
<p>This screen will generate your recovery seed, which is 12 words that will be used
    to create your master private key.  These 12 words can be used to recover your wallet
    in the event that you lose your password or don't have access to your wallet.  Your
    12 word recovery phase cannot ever be recreated or restored.
</p>
<p>
    The entropy (randomness) of your recovery phrase will be generated from your password, the 
    current time and the picture that you draw below.
